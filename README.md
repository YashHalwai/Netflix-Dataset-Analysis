# Netflix-Dataset-Analysis

In this project, I learn how to work on a real project of Data Analysis with Python.

Questions are given in the project and then I solved with the help of Python.

It is a project of Data Analysis with Python or you can say, Data Science with Python. 

The commands that we used in this project: 
1)	head() - It shows the first N rows in the data (by default, N=5). 
2)	tail () - It shows the last N rows in the data (by default, N=5). 
3)	shape - It shows the total no. of rows and no. of columns of the dataframe. 
4)	size - To show No. of total values(elements) in the dataset. 
5)	columns - To show each Column Name.
6)	dtypes - To show the data-type of each column. 
7)	info() - To show indexes, columns, data-types of each column, memory at once. 
8)	value_counts - In a column, it shows all the unique values with their count. It can be applied on a single column only. 
9)	unique() - It shows the all unique values of the series. 
10)	nunique() - It shows the total no. of unique values in the series. 
11)	duplicated( ) - To check row wise and detect the Duplicate rows. 
12)	isnull( ) - To show where Null value is present. 
13)	dropna( ) - It drops the rows that contains all missing values. 
14)	isin( ) - To show all records including particular elements. 
15)	str.contains( ) - To get all records that contains a given string. 
16)	str.split( ) - It splits a column's string into different columns. 
17)	to_datetime( ) - Converts the data-type of Date-Time Column into datetime[ns] datatype.
18)	dt.year.value_counts( ) - It counts the occurrence of all individual years in Time column. 
19)	groupby( ) - Groupby is used to split the data into groups based on some criteria. 
20)	sns.countplot(df['Col_name']) - To show the count of all unique values of any column in the form of bar graph. 
21)	max( ), min( ) - It shows the maximum/minimum value of the series. 
22)	mean( ) - It shows the mean value of the series. 

I learn these things also:

1.	Creating New Columns & Dataframe 
2.	Filtering (Single Column & Multiple Columns) 
3.	Filtering with And and OR
4.	Seaborn Library - Bar Graphs
